Isn't it awesome how `optparse` and `argparse` generate help messages
based on your code?!

*Hell no!*  You know what's awesome?  It's when the option parser *is* generated
based on the beautiful help message that you write yourself!  This way
you don't need to write this stupid repeatable parser-code, and instead can
write only the help message--*the way you want it*.
